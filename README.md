We defined the inner c-differential uniformtut (cDU) concept and extended the differential attack via the new c-differential F(cx+a)+F(x).
We then put together an implementation of the Russian standard cipher, Kuznyechik, and a comprehensive statistical suite to investigate 
truncated cDU distinguishers in this cipher. The programs (labeled with R1-R9), will analyze Kuznyechik for every round 
from Round 1 to full Round 9. The txt files' outcomes of these runs are also included.
