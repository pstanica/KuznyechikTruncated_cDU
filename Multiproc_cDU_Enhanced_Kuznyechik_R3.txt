DETAILED STATISTICAL ANALYSIS for c=0xe1, byte_4_in->byte_4_out
================================================================================
DISTRIBUTION PROPERTIES:
  Total unique pairs observed: 65,280
  Mean/Median/Std Dev count: 76.29 / 76.00 / 8.70
  Max/Min count: 113 / 42
  Skewness/Kurtosis: 0.098 / 0.003

ENHANCED BIAS METRICS:
  KL Divergence: 0.006516
  Max Chi-square: 17.66
  Relative Entropy: 0.999

NORMALITY TESTS (on the distribution of observed counts):
  Shapiro-Wilk Test: Skipped. Reason: Dataset too large for Shapiro-Wilk (N >= 5000)
  Anderson-Darling Test: Statistic=41.227
    Critical Values (Sig Levels): [0.576, 0.656, 0.787, 0.918, 1.092] ([15.0, 10.0, 5.0, 2.5, 1.0])
    (Interpretation: Statistic > Critical Value at a given significance level suggests non-normal distribution)

GOODNESS-OF-FIT TESTS (vs. Uniform Distribution):
  (Evaluates if the overall distribution of 65,280 pairs is uniform. Degrees of freedom: 65,279)
  Chi-square Test: Statistic=64,721.51, P-value=9.389e-01
  G-test (Log-likelihood): Statistic=64,904.24, P-value=8.502e-01
    (Interpretation: A very small P-value, e.g., < 0.001, provides strong evidence that the cipher's
     output for this configuration is not uniformly distributed as a whole.)

CLUSTER ANALYSIS:
  Found 1 clusters, 0 significant
  Cluster 1: 65280 members, combined p=1.000e+00, avg bias=1.00x

SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENTIAL PAIRS (FDR-corrected p < 5.023e-03):
  (These are specific (Input Diff, Output Diff) pairs whose observed frequencies
   are statistically different from expected, after multiple-test correction.)
  No pairs met the corrected significance threshold.
