*** NON-RANDOMNESS ANOMALY DETECTED (Global Distribution) ***
    Config: byte_8_in->byte_8_out, c=0x1, Rounds: 1
    The overall distribution of output differentials is NOT UNIFORM.
    G-test p-value: 1.227e-09 is less than the threshold of 1.000e-03.
    This provides strong statistical evidence of a non-random property for this configuration.

DETAILED STATISTICAL ANALYSIS for c=0xe1, byte_6_in->byte_6_out
================================================================================
DISTRIBUTION PROPERTIES:
  Total unique pairs observed: 65,280
  Mean/Median/Std Dev count: 76.29 / 76.00 / 8.71
  Max/Min count: 116 / 45
  Skewness/Kurtosis: 0.119 / 0.001

ENHANCED BIAS METRICS:
  KL Divergence: 0.006531
  Max Chi-square: 20.67
  Relative Entropy: 0.999

NORMALITY TESTS (on the distribution of observed counts):
  Shapiro-Wilk Test: Skipped. Reason: Dataset too large for Shapiro-Wilk (N >= 5000)
  Anderson-Darling Test: Statistic=46.283
    Critical Values (Sig Levels): [0.576, 0.656, 0.787, 0.918, 1.092] ([15.0, 10.0, 5.0, 2.5, 1.0])
    (Interpretation: Statistic > Critical Value at a given significance level suggests non-normal distribution)

GOODNESS-OF-FIT TESTS (vs. Uniform Distribution):
  (Evaluates if the overall distribution of 65,280 pairs is uniform. Degrees of freedom: 65,279)
  Chi-square Test: Statistic=64,921.49, P-value=8.388e-01
  G-test (Log-likelihood): Statistic=65,050.79, P-value=7.358e-01
    (Interpretation: A very small P-value, e.g., < 0.001, provides strong evidence that the cipher's
     output for this configuration is not uniformly distributed as a whole.)
